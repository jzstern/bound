# BOUND: Curation and Artist Fundraising

Content creators are underpaid. Fans don't have a meaningful and mutually beneficial way to directly support their favorite artists. BOUND allows content creators to further monetize content in a novel way. Their profits scale alongside the growth of their dedicated fanbase, and the fans receive to major forms of value:

## BOUND Features
1. Enjoy benefits of an exclusive "club" that provides access to premium content. For example, a musician could offer early album downloads, signed merchandise, Bound-exclusive concerts, etc. For as long as a fan holds the token, they retain access to all current and future rewards.

2. Fans have the ability to invest in and profit off of the speculative market around the future success of an artist. Early adopters are rewarded the most, but even those who might lose money by selling back into the bonding curve at a loss still support the content creator.

Artists are able to continually profit as long as people are buying & selling the token, and they are able to establish a more meaningful connection with their fans
